System Components and Requirements
1. System Architecture
Multi-Agent Framework

Multiple specialized agents collaborating and competing, including:

Technical Analysis Agents

Fundamental Analysis Agents

Decision Fusion Agent

Risk Management Agent

Portfolio Management Agent

Execution Agent

Communication Protocol

Standardized APIs for agents' communication with Agent2Agent protocol.

Modularity & Extensibility

Support for adding/removing agents dynamically.

Configurable parameters for agents (e.g., thresholds, weights, analysis periods).

2. Data Collection and Management

Historical Data

Market historical data (OHLCV, financial statements, macroeconomic data).

Minimum 2-5 years for effective backtesting.

Sources: Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, FactSet, etc.

Real-time Market Data

Live OHLCV streams.

Level II order book data (if necessary).

Real-time news sentiment streams.

Fundamental Data

Financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow).

Ratios: P/E, EPS, Debt-to-Equity, ROE, ROA, etc.

Analyst ratings, forecasts, and estimates.

Technical Indicators

Moving averages (SMA, EMA).

RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands.

Fibonacci retracements, VWAP, etc.

News and Sentiment Data

Market news APIs.

Sentiment analysis models or APIs (e.g., Google NLP, Azure Cognitive Services).

3. Analysis Components
Technical Analysis Agents:
Trend-Following Agents

Identify trending stocks based on indicators like Moving Averages and MACD.

Mean-Reversion Agents

Identify short-term price anomalies (e.g., RSI oversold/overbought conditions).

Volume and Momentum Agents

Detect unusual trading volumes or rapid price changes.

Fundamental Analysis Agents:
Valuation Agents

Identify undervalued or overvalued stocks based on intrinsic valuation methods (DCF, multiples).

Financial Strength Agents

Assess companyâ€™s financial health (balance sheet, cash flow).

Growth Potential Agents

Evaluate companies' growth prospects (earnings growth, industry position, management effectiveness).

4. Decision-Making & Fusion Agent
Fusion Methodology

Weighted score fusion based on historical accuracy of agents.

Machine learning methods (random forests, ensemble models) for final decision-making.

Voting & Consensus

Majority voting or consensus-based decisions for signals from multiple agents.

Dynamic Learning

Reinforcement learning or incremental learning approaches to adapt and improve decision accuracy over time.

5. Backtesting Engine
Historical Simulation

Supports multiple backtesting modes (walk-forward, rolling-window, Monte Carlo simulations).

Performance Metrics

Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Drawdown analysis.

Win-rate, profit factor, volatility measures.

Strategy Optimization

Parameter optimization (grid search, genetic algorithms, Bayesian optimization).

Risk-Adjusted Testing

Stress testing for extreme market conditions.

Visualization and Reporting

Comprehensive reporting with visualizations (equity curves, trade logs, performance heatmaps).

6. Risk Management Agent
Risk Assessment

Position sizing based on portfolio risk constraints (Kelly criterion, fixed fractional sizing).

Stop-Loss & Take-Profit

Implement automatic stop-loss and trailing stops based on volatility or fixed percentages.

Exposure Management

Limits on exposure to individual stocks, sectors, and asset classes.

Dynamic Risk Adjustment

Adjust risk parameters based on market volatility and overall market conditions.

7. Portfolio Management Agent
Portfolio Construction

Diversification strategies.

Dynamic rebalancing based on signals and market conditions.

Capital Allocation

Optimization techniques for allocation of funds (Markowitz Mean-Variance optimization, CVaR optimization).

Portfolio Monitoring

Real-time tracking of portfolio metrics, compliance with defined constraints.

8. Execution Agent
Broker API Integration

Compatible with major trading platforms (Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, Fidelity, etc.).

Order Execution Strategies

Market orders, limit orders, conditional orders, and automated order splitting for large trades.

Latency Management

Efficient execution algorithms to minimize slippage and improve execution speed.

9. Monitoring, Reporting & Logging
Real-time Dashboard

Dashboard for real-time monitoring of system status, portfolio performance, risk metrics, and trading activities.

Audit and Compliance

Detailed logging for all decisions, agent outputs, backtesting results, trades, and portfolio adjustments.

Alerts and Notifications

Automated alerts for critical events (trade execution, risk breaches, market anomalies).

10. Infrastructure & Deployment
Cloud-based or Hybrid Infrastructure

AWS cloud hosting 

Scalability and Reliability

Horizontal scaling capability.

High availability and redundancy.

Security & Compliance

Secure API access, encryption, authentication, authorization.

Compliance with financial industry regulations.

11. Performance Monitoring & Optimization
Continuous Learning

Incremental updating of models based on new data.

Regular performance reviews and iterative improvements.

Latency & Throughput Monitoring

Regular system performance assessments to ensure responsiveness and reliability.
